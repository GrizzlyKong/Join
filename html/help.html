    Welcome to the help page for <span>Join</span>, your guide to using our kanban project management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what<br> <span>Join</span> is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.<br> <br> 
    <h1>What is Join?</h1>
    <span>Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of their web<br>  development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.<br> <br> 
    
    Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize<br>  efficiency (or flow). <span>Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual<br>  interface.<br><br>  
    
    It is important to note that <span>Join</span> is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we<br>  strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects<br>  of quality regarding <span>Join</span>.<br> 
    
    <h1>How to use it</h1>
    Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span>Join</span>:
    <div class="step"><h1>1.</h1>
    <ul><h2>Exploring the Board</h2>
    When you log in to <span>Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do",<br>  "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
    </ul>
  </div><div class="step"><h1>2.</h1>
    <ul><h2>Creating Contacts</h2>
    In <span>Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in<br>  the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the<br>  board.
  </ul>
</div><div class="step"><h1>3.</h1>
    <ul><h2>Adding Cards</h2>
    Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under<br>  the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees,<br>  etc.
  </ul>
</div><div class="step"><h1>4.</h1>
    <ul><h2>Moving Cards</h2>
    As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one<br>  list to another.
  </ul>
</div><div class="step"><h1>5.</h1>
    <ul><h2>Deleting Cards</h2>
    Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from<br>  the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.<br> <br> 
    
    Remember that using <span>Join</span> effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the<br>  current state of your project.<br> <br>
