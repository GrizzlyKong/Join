    Relevant Legal Bases
    Relevant legal bases under the GDPR: Below, you will find an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that, in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations in your or our country of residence or establishment may apply.
    If more specific legal bases are applicable in individual cases, we will inform you in the privacy policy.
    
    Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) - The data subject has given consent to the processing of their personal data for a specific purpose or multiple specific purposes.
    Contractual performance and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR) - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with the data subject or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures requested by the data subject.
    Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) - Processing is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the data controller or a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, requiring the protection of personal data, prevail.
    National data protection regulations in Germany: In addition to the GDPR, national data protection regulations in Germany apply. This includes, in particular, the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz â€“ BDSG).
    The BDSG contains special regulations on the right to information, the right to deletion, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes, and transmission, as well as automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling.
    In addition, the data protection laws of individual federal states may apply.
    
    Reference to the applicability of the GDPR and Swiss DPA: These data protection notices serve both to provide information under the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (Swiss DPA) and under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
    Therefore, please note that, due to the broader spatial application and understanding, the terms of the GDPR are used.
    In particular, instead of the terms used in the Swiss DPA such as "processing" of "personal data," "overriding interest," and "particularly sensitive personal data," the terms used in the GDPR such as "processing" of "personal data," "legitimate interest," and "special categories of data" are used.
    However, the legal meaning of the terms is determined within the scope of the applicability of the Swiss DPA.
    
    Security Measures
    In accordance with legal requirements and considering the state of the art, implementation costs, and the nature, scope, circumstances, and purposes of processing, as well as the varying likelihoods and the severity of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons,
    we implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection that is appropriate to the risk.
    
    These measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data, as well as access, input, disclosure, availability, and separation.
    Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subjects' rights, the deletion of data, and responses to the threat to data. We also take into account the protection of personal data in the development or
    selection of hardware, software, and procedures, in accordance with the principles of data protection, through the design of technology and through privacy-friendly settings.
    
    Transfer of Personal Data
    In the course of processing personal data, it may occur that the data is transferred to other entities, companies, legally independent organizational units, or individuals or disclosed to them.
    Recipients of this data may include service providers or providers of services and content responsible for IT tasks or integrated into a website.
    In such cases, we comply with legal requirements and, in particular, conclude appropriate contracts or agreements that serve to protect your data with the recipients of your data.
    
    International Data Transfers
    Data processing in third countries: If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA)) or if the processing takes place as part of the use of third-party services or the disclosure or
    transfer of data to other individuals, entities, or companies, this only occurs in accordance with legal requirements. If the level of data protection in the third country has been recognized by means of an adequacy decision (Art. 45 GDPR), this decision serves as the basis for data transfer.
    Otherwise, data transfers only take place if the level of data protection is otherwise secured, in particular through standard contractual clauses (Art. 46(2)(c) GDPR), explicit consent, or in the case of contractual or legally required transfer (Art. 49(1) GDPR).
    Furthermore, we will inform you about the basis for third-country transfers with each provider from the third country, with adequacy decisions taking precedence as the basis. Information on third-country transfers and existing adequacy decisions can be found in the information provided by
    the European Commission: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en.
    
    EU-US Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework: Within the framework of the so-called "Data Privacy Framework" (DPF), the EU Commission has also recognized the level of data protection for certain companies from the USA as safe, as part of the adequacy decision of July 10, 2023.
    The list of certified companies and further information on the DPF can be found on the website of the US Department of Commerce at https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/.
    We will inform you within the framework of the privacy policy about which service providers certified under the Data Privacy Framework we use.
    
    Rights of Data Subjects
    Rights of data subjects under the GDPR: Data subjects have various rights under the GDPR, arising in particular from Articles 15 to 21 of the GDPR:
    
    Right to object: You have the right to object at any time, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you, which is carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)(e) or (f) GDPR; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions.
    If the personal data concerning you is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for the purpose of such advertising; this also applies to profiling insofar as it is related to such direct marketing.
    Right to withdraw consent: You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
    Right to information: You have the right to request confirmation as to whether data concerning you are being processed and to obtain information about this data and further information and a copy of the data in accordance with legal requirements.

    Right to data portability: You have the right to receive the data concerning you that you have provided to us in a structured, common, and machine-readable format, or to request its transfer to another data controller in accordance with legal requirements.
    Complaint to the supervisory authority: Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, your place of work,
    or the place of the alleged infringement, if you believe that the processing of personal data concerning you violates the requirements of the GDPR.
    Use of Cookies
    Cookies are small text files or other storage technologies that store information on end devices and retrieve information from end devices. For example, to store the login status in a user account, the contents of a shopping cart in an online shop,
    the accessed content, or the functions used in an online offering. Cookies can also be used for various purposes, such as functionality, security, and convenience of online offerings, as well as for the analysis of visitor flows.
    
    Notes on consent: We use cookies in accordance with legal regulations. Therefore, we obtain prior consent from users, unless it is not legally required. Consent is not necessary, in particular, if storing and reading information, including cookies,
    is absolutely necessary to provide users with a telemedia service (i.e., our online offering) expressly requested by them. Essential cookies usually include cookies with functions that serve the display and functionality of the online offering, load balancing, security,
    storage of user preferences and choices, or similar purposes related to the provision of the main and secondary functions of the online offering requested by users. Revocable consent is clearly communicated to users and includes information about the respective cookie usage.
    
    Notes on data protection legal bases: The legal basis on which we process users' personal data using cookies depends on whether we ask users for consent. If users consent, the legal basis for processing their data is the declared consent.
    Otherwise, data processed using cookies based on our legitimate interests (e.g., in the business operation of our online offering and improvement of its usability) or, if cookies are necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations, based on the necessity of using cookies
    to fulfill our contractual obligations. We will inform you about the purposes for which we process cookies as part of this privacy policy or in the context of our consent and processing processes.
    
    Storage duration: With regard to storage duration, the following types of cookies are distinguished:

    Temporary Cookies (also: Session or Session Cookies): Temporary cookies are deleted at the latest after a user has left an online offering and closed their end device (e.g., browser or mobile application).

    Persistent Cookies: Persistent cookies remain stored even after closing the end device. For example, login status can be saved, or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user revisits a website. The data collected through cookies can also be used for audience measurement.
    If we do not provide users with explicit information about the type and duration of cookies (e.g., as part of obtaining consent), users should assume that cookies are persistent and can have a storage duration of up to two years.
    
    General Information on Revocation and Objection (so-called "Opt-Out"): Users can revoke the consents they have given at any time and object to processing in accordance with legal requirements. To do this, users can restrict the use of cookies in their browser settings
    (which may also limit the functionality of our online offering). Objection to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes can also be declared through the websites https://optout.aboutads.info and https://www.youronlinechoices.com/.
    
    Legal Basis: Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR). Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR).

    Processing of Cookie Data based on Consent: We use a cookie consent management process in which user consents to the use of cookies or the processing and providers mentioned in the context of the cookie consent management process are obtained, managed, and revoked by users.
    The consent declaration is stored to avoid having to repeat the request and to be able to prove consent in accordance with legal obligations. Storage can be server-side and/or in a cookie (so-called opt-in cookie or similar technologies) to associate consent with a user or their device.
    Subject to individual information about providers of cookie management services, the following information applies: The storage duration of the consent can be up to two years. A pseudonymous user identifier is created, and information about the consent scope
    (e.g., which categories of cookies and/or service providers) as well as the browser, system, and used end device are stored; Legal basis: Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR).
    
    Provision of the Online Offering and Web Hosting: We process user data to provide them with our online services. For this purpose, we process the user's IP address, which is necessary to transmit the content and functions of our online services to the user's browser or device.
    
    Processed Data Types: Usage Data (e.g., visited web pages, interest in content, access times); Meta, Communication, and Process Data (e.g., IP addresses, time data, identification numbers, consent status). Data Subjects: Users (e.g., website visitors, users of online services).

    browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page), and usually IP addresses and the requesting provider. Server log files can be used for security purposes, e.g., to avoid overloading the servers (especially in the case of abusive attacks, so-called DDoS attacks) and to ensure the load and stability of the servers;
    Legal basis: Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR). Data deletion: Log file information is stored for a maximum of 30 days and then deleted or anonymized. Data whose further storage is necessary for evidentiary purposes is excluded from deletion until the final clarification of the respective incident.

    Plugins and Embedded Functions and Content: We integrate functional and content elements into our online offering that are obtained from the servers of their respective providers (hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers"). This can include, for example, graphics, videos, or maps (hereinafter collectively referred to as "content").
    
    Integration always requires that the third-party providers of this content process the IP address of users because they could not send the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP address is thus required for the presentation of this content or functions.
    We strive to use only content whose respective providers use the IP address solely for the delivery of the content. Third-party providers may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. "Pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information, such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website.
    The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on users' devices and may include technical information about the browser and operating system, referring web pages, visit time, as well as other information about the use of our online offering, and may also be linked to such information from other sources.
    
    Processed Data Types: Usage Data (e.g., visited web pages, interest in content, access times); Meta, Communication, and Process Data (e.g., IP addresses, time data, identification numbers, consent status). Data Subjects: Users (e.g., website visitors, users of online services). Purposes of Processing: Provision of our online offering and user-friendliness.
    Legal Basis: Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR).
    
    Additional Notes on Processing Processes, Procedures, and Services:
    
    Google Fonts (Access from the Google Server): Access to fonts (and symbols) for the purpose of technically secure, maintenance-free, and efficient use of fonts and symbols with regard to currentness and loading times, their uniform representation, and consideration of possible license restrictions.
    The provider of the fonts is informed of the user's IP address so that the fonts can be made available to the user's browser. In addition, technical data (language settings, screen resolution, operating system, hardware used) are transmitted, which are necessary for the provision of the fonts depending on the devices used and the technical environment.
    This data may be processed on a server of the font provider in the USA - When visiting our online offering, users' browsers send their browser HTTP requests to the Google Fonts Web API (i.e., a software interface for retrieving fonts). The Google Fonts Web API provides users with the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) of Google Fonts and then the fonts specified in the CSS.
    These HTTP requests include (1) the IP address used by the respective user to access the internet, (2) the requested URL on the Google server, and (3) the HTTP headers, including the user agent describing the browser and operating system versions of the website visitors, as well as the referring URL (i.e., the website on which the Google font is to be displayed).
    IP addresses are neither logged nor stored on Google servers, and they are not analyzed. The Google Fonts Web API logs details of HTTP requests (requested URL, user agent, and referring URL). Access to this data is restricted and strictly controlled. The requested URL identifies the font families for which the user wants to load fonts.
    This data is logged so that Google can determine how often a specific font family is requested. With the Google Fonts Web API, the user agent must adapt the font to the browser type generated for the respective browser type. The user agent is primarily logged for debugging and used to generate aggregated usage statistics that measure the popularity of font families.
    These aggregated usage statistics are published on the Google Fonts "Analytics" page. Finally, the referring URL is logged so that the data can be used for production maintenance and an aggregated report on the top integrations based on the number of font requests can be generated.
    According to Google's own information, none of the information collected by Google Fonts is used to create profiles of end users or to display targeted ads.
